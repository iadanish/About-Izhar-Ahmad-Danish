**Projects:**

**Autonomous Latest Article Writer** Automated Publishing Pipeline Built a fully automated media engine capable of running a news site with zero daily human effort.
Full Automation: Created a "set and forget" system that discovers trending topics from 20+ sources, filters noise, and writes professional-grade articles automatically.
Scalability: The system processes and publishes 15+ high-quality articles daily, handling everything from image generation to HTML formatting and category management.
Integration: Seamlessly connected multiple platforms, using Notion for editorial dashboards and WordPress for public facing content, orchestrated via GitHub Actions for reliability.
Cost Efficiency: Optimized API usage by implementing a tiered fallback system (using cheaper/faster models first) to maintain low operational costs while ensuring high uptime.
Total Cost: $0

**ThumbSnap AI** – Generative Design SaaS Platform Built a commercial-grade application that eliminates the design bottleneck for content creators by automating professional thumbnail production.
Intelligent Automation: Engineered a single-pass orchestration engine that interprets simple user intent to generate complex, prompt-engineered visual assets, effectively reducing a 2-hour design process to under 30 seconds.
Commercial Economy: Implemented a robust "credits-as-currency" backend using Supabase and SQL transactions to securely manage user balances, tiered usage limits, and real-time deductions with financial-grade accuracy.
Seamless Integration: Orchestrated a high-performance architecture connecting Next.js with Google Vertex AI, handling asynchronous generation tasks, asset storage, and history tracking without compromising UI responsiveness.
